Why use prototype inheritance
    When you have created a function with three properties and you have created a object out of it,
    but later you just want to add a function/property to it without adding anything to old declaration.
    Properties added to prototype does not take memory of object but always available because of prototype chain.

function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}
  
Person.prototype.nationality = "English";   //we have not added to body of Person

const a = new Person("max","payne",12,"black")

console.log(a.nationality)  //English
//Still we are able to access nationality as a property of instance of Person
