we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs,
 and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.
 
 
  Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package 
  (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace)
